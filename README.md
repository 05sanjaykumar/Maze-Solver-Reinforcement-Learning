### ✅ What I’ve Already Done (🔥)

1. **Normal Grid Solving**
   - BFS, A*, basic search algorithms.
   - No learning, just smart searching.

2. **Q-Learning**
   - Table-based learning.
   - Good for small, fixed environments.

3. **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)**
   - Uses a neural network instead of a table.
   - Can generalize to much larger or dynamic environments.

### 🔜 What Next After DQN?

Here’s the sequence many AI agents evolve through:

---

### 🔹 4. **Dueling DQN**
- Separates **value of state** vs. **value of action**.
- Learns more efficiently, especially when actions don't change the outcome much.
- Still based on DQN, just smarter architecture.

---

### 🔹 5. **Double DQN**
- Reduces overestimation in action values.
- Fixes a known weakness in standard DQN where the agent becomes overconfident.

---

### 🔹 6. **Prioritized Experience Replay**
- Instead of random replay, prioritize experiences that are more surprising or useful.
- Speeds up learning significantly.

---

### 🔹 7. **Actor-Critic Methods**
- Instead of just learning value (like Q-values), you also learn a **policy**.
- These methods form the core of many **modern agents**.
- Two networks: **Actor** (chooses actions) + **Critic** (judges them).

Famous versions:
- **A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic)**
- **A3C (Asynchronous A2C)**
- **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)** ← Most popular today

---

### 🔹 8. **Policy Gradient Methods**
- Directly optimize the agent's policy, not Q-values.
- Useful when actions are **continuous** (e.g., robot arms).
- Great for real-world robotics, video games, and more.

---

### 🔹 9. **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**
- Multiple agents learning in the same environment.
- Competing (zero-sum) or cooperating (team-based).
- Example: StarCraft AI, self-driving cars in traffic.

---

### 🔹 10. **Self-Play + Meta Learning**
- Agents train against themselves.
- AlphaGo, OpenAI Five (Dota2), MuZero use self-play.
- Goal: create **agents that adapt** quickly to new tasks.

---

### 🌐 Beyond RL: Integration With Other Domains

- 🧩 **RL + Computer Vision** (for real-world perception)
- 📚 **RL + NLP** (language understanding + dialogue)
- 🛠️ **RL + Robotics** (control physical devices)
- 💡 **Curriculum Learning** (gradually increasing difficulty)

---

### 🔮 Final Boss Level
- **Autonomous Agents** with **lifelong learning**.
- Transfer knowledge across tasks.
- Learn in simulation and apply in the real world.
